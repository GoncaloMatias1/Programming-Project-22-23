## Description:

In this project you will use C++ to represent and process RGB color images with 8-bits per RGB channel. Starting code is provided with the initial code skeletons, along with support for reading and writing images encoded in the PNG format and test code for you to validate your work.

You will need to develop code for the following classes in the C++ namespace prog:

prog::Color to represent RGB colors;
prog::Image to represent images where individual pixels are represented by Color;
and prog::Script to process scripts that contain image manipulation commands.
Some additional challenges are also presented in this document.
